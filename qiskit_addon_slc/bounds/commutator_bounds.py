    Given a circuit with :class:`.BoxOp` instructions with :class:`.InjectNoise` annotations and a
    mapping of noise model identifiers (:attr:`.InjectNoise.ref`) to list of Pauli error terms
    (``noise_model_paulis``), this function computes the unequal time commutator bounds (the details
    of which are implemented by ``norm_fn``). In doing so, it only considers gates that lie within
    the light-cone of the observable (initialized by ``light_cone``). These computed bounds form the
    basis of the shaded light-cone.

    Since this function performs a long-running computation, it gracefully handles
    ``KeyboardInterrupt`` exceptions, allowing the user to interrupt the computation at an arbitrary
    point in time and still obtain the results that have been computed up to that point.

    Args:
        circuit: the target circuit.
        noise_model_paulis: the Pauli error terms to consider for each noise model.
        light_cone: the initialized and stateful :class:`.LightCone` tracker.
        norm_fn: the function implementing the specific unequal time commutator.
        backwards: whether to iterate over the ``circuit`` in reverse.
        max_num_boxes: the maximum number of boxes for which to compute bounds. Bounds for any
            additional boxes will be given the trivial upper bound value of :math:`2.0`.
        num_processes: the number of parallel processes to use.
        timeout: an optional timeout (in seconds) after which all remaining layers are filled with
            trivial numerical bounds of ``2.0``. Note, that this is not a strict timeout and the
            layer being processed at the time of reaching this timeout will complete normally.
        parent_span: an optional parent span for distributed tracing. If provided, a child span
            will be created under it. If None, a root span will be created.
